\begin{abstract}
The study of anthropogenic impacts on the environment can be addressed through dated sedimentary records for the last \sim 100-200 years. During this period, radiocarbon ($^{14}$C) dating suffers from poor resolution and large uncertainties. To overcome this limitation, $^{210}$Pb (lead-210) dating has been widely adopted as it provides absolute and continuous dates for this period. However, the Constant Rate of Supply (CRS, or Constant Flux - CF) model, which relies on the radioactive decay equation as an age-depth relationship, limits the accuracy of the model used to estimate older dates. In this work, we compare a classical approach to $^{210}$Pb dating (CRS) with Plum, a Bayesian approach developed for analyzing sedimentary ^210Pb measurements. 

Simulated $^{210}$Pb profiles were generated according to three different sedimentation processes and constructed using the CRS model assumptions, which we analyzed using both methods. Our results indicate that the CRS model sometimes fails to capture true age values, and accuracy does not improve with more information. In contrast, Plum consistently provides more accurate results, even with relatively small sample sizes, and improves accuracy and precision with additional information.\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

	Lead-210 ($^{210}$Pb) is a naturally occurring radioactive isotope that is part of the $^{238}$U decay chain and is formed in both the atmosphere and sediments. $^{210}$Pb forms in the atmosphere through the decay of radon-222 ($^{222}$Rn), a gas that is released from soil and rocks. $^{222}Rn$ decays quickly to $^{210}$Pb, attaches to aerosols and other atmospheric particles and can gets deposit onto the earth's surface through dry and wet fallout. The constant fallout of $^{210}$Pb is called flux, and the atmospheric $^{210}$Pb is called excess or unsupported $^{210}$Pb. Once on the ground, excess $^{210}$Pb can be transported, entering the sediment and mixing with in situ formed $^{210}$Pb (supported $^{210}$Pb). As sediment accumulates over time, $^{210}$Pb is constantly buried in the sediment column, providing a chronological record of sediment deposition. This isotope, with a half-life of 22.23 $\pm$ 0.12 years, is commonly used to date recently accumulated sediments ($<150$ years) and has become increasingly popular in recent decades for palaeoecological and pollution studies aimed at evaluating human impacts on the environment \citep[e.g.,][]{Courtney2019}.

	The accuracy of chronologies is critical in environmental studies to correctly assign dates to physical, chemical, geological, biological, and ecological changes. Unlike other dating techniques, such as radiocarbon dating, dating a single sediment layer using a single $^{210}$Pb measurement is not possible. Instead, $^{210}$Pb activity is measured at different depths along a core (e.g., lake, peatland, marine sediments). A $^{210}$Pb-chronology can only be established under certain assumptions regarding the sedimentation process and when a suitable portion of the excess ^210Pb decay curve is measured. The analysis of a complete series (data set) of ^210Pb measurements must be carried out to obtain meaningful dates \citet{Aquino2018}.


	% A range of traditional data analyses, so called ``models'', are available for dating recent sediments using $^{210}$Pb; e.g. the Constant Initial Concentration \citep[CIC,][]{Goldberg1963}, also known as Constant Activity \citep[CA,][]{Robbins1975}, the Constant Flux : Constant sedimentation \citep[CF:CS,][]{Crozaz1964} and the Constant Rate of Supply  \citep[CRS,][]{Appleby1978,Robbins1978,Sanchez-Cabeza2012} also known as the Constant Flux model (CF). 
% The main assumption of the CIC model is that sediments have a constant initial $^{210}$Pb concentration. 
% Both CF:CS and CRS models assume a constant flux of $^{210}$Pb, but the CF:CS model also assumes that the sedimentation rate is constant. 
% The CRS model is by far the most popular (see Figure \ref{fig:210models}) and allows for estimating variable mass accumulation rates.
% The flexibility of the CRS model, in terms of its assumptions, comes at the cost of needing to measure a sufficient portion of the excess $^{210}$Pb inventory or the use of interpolation/extrapolation in order to properly estimate the complete inventory of $^{210}$Pb in the sediment. 


Several traditional data analysis models are available for dating recent sediments using $^{210}$Pb. These include the Constant Initial Concentration (CIC) model, also known as Constant Activity (CA) \citep{Goldberg1963, Robbins1975}, the Constant Flux : Constant Sedimentation (CF:CS) model \citep{Crozaz1964}, and the Constant Rate of Supply (CRS) model, also known as the Constant Flux model (CF) \citep{Appleby1978, Robbins1978, Sanchez-Cabeza2012}. The CIC model assumes that sediments have a constant initial $^{210}$Pb concentration, while both the CF:CS and CRS models assume a constant flux of $^{210}$Pb. The CF:CS model also assumes a constant sedimentation rate. Of these models, the CRS model is the most popular, as it allows for estimating of variable mass accumulation rates (see Figure \ref{fig:210models}). However, the flexibility of the CRS model in terms of its assumptions comes at a cost, as it requires the measurement of a sufficient portion of the excess $^{210}$Pb inventory, which is the total amount of excess $^{210}$Pb in the sediment, or the use of interpolation/extrapolation in order to estimate the complete $^{210}$Pb inventory in the sediment.

%Caro quiere que este párrafo se integre al párrafo donde se habla de las modificaciones revisar después  
% moverlo a otra parte 
In recent years, the CRS model has undergone several modifications to enhance its accuracy and practicality \citep{Binford1990,Appleby2001,Sanchez-Cabeza2014}. These modifications can be classified into two categories: (1) improvements in the model's uncertainty quantification, and (2) adjustments to the model's application when additional information is available, such as the presence of external dating markers like $^{137}$Cs profiles, laminated sediments, tephras, and contaminated layers that correspond to known sedimentary events \citep{Appleby1998,Appleby2001,Appleby2008}.

	A recent inter-laboratory model comparison experiment \citep{Barsanti2020}presented poor consistency of chronologies.
Two measured $^{210}$Pbdatasets were sent to 14 laboratories worldwide, with varying degrees of expertise. Each laboratory was asked to provide a chronology, given the same dataset. Each laboratory used its preferred model, in most cases the CRS model. This experiment resulted in a wide range of chronologies, independently of the model used, providing different results even when the same model and dataset were used. The authors reinforced the need to use independent time markers (independent dating sources) to validate and "anchor" the chronologies, as suggested previously by \citet{Smith2001}.  
This comparison experiment clearly and critically shows the impact of user decisions and expert adaptations/revisions on the resulting chronologies. In order to replicate and update any given chronology, documenting such user decisions becomes extremely important, such as providing the raw data. However, raw data sets and user decisions are rarely reported.

In recent years, \citet{Aquino2018} introduced a Bayesian approach to $^{210}$Pb dating, named the \textit{Plum} model, an alternative to the classical models. In this approach, every data point is considered to originate from a forward model that takes into account both the sedimentation process and the radioactive decay process. The \textit{Plum} model also assumes a constant flux of excess $^{210}$Pb to the sediment, similar to the CRS model, although this assumption can be relaxed at the expense of computational power. One important difference between the two models is that \textit{Plum} includes the supported $^{210}$Pb, a naturally occurring component in sediments usually treated as a hindrance variable (i.e., the assumed supported 210Pb values are removed before further modelling).

	\citet{Blaauw2018} presented a comparison between the construction of classical and Bayesian age-depth models construction, both for real and simulated $^{14}$C-dated cores.
They concluded that Bayesian age-depth models provide a more accurate result with a more realistic uncertainties under a wide range of scenarios.  
The objective of the present study was to test whether similar results are maintained in a more complex modelling situation, such as the construction of $^{210}$Pb-based age-depth models.
To do so, we compared $^{210}$Pb dates (accuracy) and uncertainties (precision) from the widely applied CRS model against \textit{Plum} using simulated cores, i.e. sedimentation ``scenarios''.
We also aimed to observe the learning process of each model and estimate the amount of information needed to obtain a reasonable chronology for each model.
This process is critical as the amount of information depends on the number of samples, which depends on the budget, time, and user decision of resources allocated to developing the age-depth model.

	The paper is organized as follows: 
Section 2 briefly introduces the CRS model which is the most widely used, as well as \textit{Plum}.
Section 3 discusses the consideration and the experimental setup.
Section 4 presents the tools we use for the model comparison, describing the three different sedimentation scenario simulations.
Section 5 compares results for the overall chronologies and for single depths.
Lastly, Section 6 presents the conclusions and discussion of the results obtained in section 5. 

\section{$^{210}$Pb Data and models}

Methods used to estimate ages from $^{210}$Pb sedimentary profiles are based on a range of assumptions, which may result in differing chronologies. Except for Plum, it is necessary to distinguish between the supported and the excess $^{210}$Pb. By estimating the excess vs. the supported $^{210}$Pb along the core, and using the radioactive exponential decay law, one can estimate the depth-age relationship of the core. Under steady-state conditions, $^{226}$Ra and supported (in situ) $^{210}$Pb are assumed to be in secular equilibrium as they are part of the same decay chain. Therefore, by measuring $^{226}$Ra in sediments using gamma spectrometry, an indirect measurement of the supported ^$^{210}$Pb can be obtained. However, as the excess and supported $^{210}$Pb inputs into sediments are otherwise indistinguishable by laboratory measurements, a proper estimation of the excess $^{210}$Pb is critical. In this section we present the data usually used for the derivation of sediment chronologies and how the supported and excess $^{210}$Pb are handled by the CRS and Plum models.  %ESTA BIEN ESTO ... ES MUY IMPORTANTE ESTE PARRAFO PARA QUE UN ESTADISTICO QUE NO SEPA DEL TAMA ENTIENDA COMO ESTA EL ROLLO.\ca

\subsection{Data}

We will provide an example of the type of data used to create $^{210}$Pb age-depth models using the dataset presented in \citet{Sanchez-Cabeza2012} and displayed in Table \ref{tab:tehuaii}. This dataset was obtained by analyzing $^{210}$Po (Pollonium-210) alpha decay  through alpha-particle spectrometry, assuming that $^{210}$Pb and $^{210}$Po are in secular equilibrium \citep[see][for details]{Sanchez-Cabeza2012}. The deepest three samples were utilized to estimate the supported $^{210}$Pb activity. Alternatively, gamma-ray spectrometry can be utilized to measure $^{226}$Ra, which can be used as a proxy for the supported $^{210}$Pb activity. Both techniques have their benefits and disadvantages. Gamma spectrometry provides measurements of $^{226}$Ra that can be used to infer the supported $^{210}$Pb, whereas alpha spectrometry provides more accurate measurements. Depending on the study's budget and the laboratory's possibilities, each study may use either technique or a combination.

	% In order \ac fix ideas \ca and introduce the nature of the data which these models use to create an age-depth model, we use the data presented by  \citet{Sanchez-Cabeza2012}, and reproduced here in Table \ref{tab:tehuaii}.
% This dataset comes from the analysis of $^{210}$Po by alpha-particle spectrometry, which provides measures of $^{210}$Pb, assuming secular equilibrium between both radionuclides. In order to have an estimate of the supported $^{210}$Pb activity, the authors used the deepest 3 samples. \ac When gamma-ray spectrometry is used, $^{226}$Ra may be measured and used as a proxy to infer the supported $^{210}$Pb activity. PORQUE NO SE USA SIMPRE gamma-ray spectrometry? USANDO gamma-ray spectrometry YA NO TENDRIAMOS PROBLEMAS, YA NO SE NECESITARIAN LOS models INCLUYENDO plum? \ca.

% \subsection{CIC}

% The Constant Initial Concentration (CIC) model \citep{Goldberg1963,Crozaz1964,Robbins1978} assumes that the initial concentration of excess $^{210}$Pb at any sediment layer is the same. 
% With this assumption, we can define the initial concentration of $^{210}$Pb at any layer as $P_0^U =$ Constant, by directly using the radioactive decay equation for the age $t_i$ of any depth $i$ as
% \begin{eqnarray}
% 	t_i = \frac{1}{\lambda}\log \left( \frac{P_0^U}{y_i}\right),
% \end{eqnarray}
% \ac where $\lambda = 0.03118\pm 0.00017$ yr$^{-1}$ is the mean life of $^{210}$Pb (decay constant). $y_i$ are the measured $^{210}$Pb concentrations of layer $i$ (see Table \ref{tab:tehuaii}). \ca

% The main assumption of this model, that sediments have a constant initial $^{210}$Pb concentration, $P_0^U$, irrespective of the sedimentation rate, is particularly strong as it implies that the $^{210}$Pb external influx to the sediment surface should be proportional to the mass accumulation. 
% This is a very restrictive condition and most likely false for most ecosystems, especially considering the impacts of land use changes on the sedimentation regimes around the world. 
% In addition, the CIC model requires the decrease of excess $^{210}$Pb monotonically down-core (uncommon in case of variable sedimentation).  Otherwise, deeper sections with higher concentrations would be younger (age reversal).
% As Figure \ref{fig:210models} shows this model is rarely used, and its application is seen in earlier studies (when other models were not available) or when other models’ requirements were not met.
% An example of the use of this model is shown at the end of this section with a comparison to the other models. For details on the application of the CIC model refer to \citet{Sanchez-Cabeza2012}.


% \subsection{CF:CS}

% This model assumes both a constant initial concentration \ac $P_0^U$ ?????? \ca  of $^{210}$Pb at any layer but also a constant accumulation rate \ac $b$ ?????? \ca over the sediment accumulated mass.  

% \begin{eqnarray}
% 	t_i = -\frac{m_i b}{\lambda},
% \end{eqnarray}
% where $m_i$ is the accumulated dry mass of the sediment up to layer $i$ (this value can be easily calculated from the density value in table \ref{tab:tehuaii}), and $b$ is approximated using linear regression with the following model,
% \begin{eqnarray}
% 	\log(y_i) &= \log(P_0^U) - \frac{\lambda}{r}m_i \\
% 		   &= \hat{a} + \hat{b}m_i.
% \end{eqnarray}

% It is important to note that this model is still very restrictive, even if it is more flexible than the previous model. 
% In addition, it is even more rarely used in practice, and again, only when the CRS model assumptions are not met.
% For the proper implementation of this model, refer to \citet{Sanchez-Cabeza2012}.


\subsection{CRS}

% Up to this point, we have dealt with models which have very restrictive assumptions and are simple extensions of the radioactive decay equation. 

The Constant Rate of Supply model \citep{Appleby1978,Appleby1998,Appleby2001,Appleby2008}, assumes that the sediment experienced a constant input of $^{210}$Pb (influx of $^{210}$Pb). In order to account for the other material deposited into the sediment, the model uses the following relationship
\begin{eqnarray}
	P_0^U(t)r(t) = \Phi,
\end{eqnarray}
where $P_0^U$ is the initial level of excess $^{210}$Pb of the sediment of age $t$, $\Phi$ is the influx of $^{210}$Pb to the sediment and $r(t)$ is the sedimentation rate at that moment (how quickly the sediment accumulates). Using this relationship and the decay equation one can reach the following relationship, 
\begin{eqnarray}
	A_{z}&=\int_{z}^{\infty}\rho(w)P^U(w)dw  \nonumber \\
	&=\int_{z}^{\infty} \Phi e^{- \lambda t(w) }\frac{dt(w)}{dw} dw \nonumber \\ 
	&=\int_{t(z)}^{\infty} \Phi e^{- \lambda y } dy,  \label{eq:sampleeqC2} 
\end{eqnarray}
where $z$ is a given depth in the sediment, $\rho(z)$ is the sediments density at depth $z$, $P^U$ is the excess $^{210}$Pb, $\Phi$ is the influx of $^{210}$Pb to the sediment and $\lambda$ the decay constant of $^{210}$Pb. From equation \ref{eq:sampleeqC2} and by defining $A_0=\int_{0}^{\infty} \Phi e^{- \lambda y } dy$, it is possible to derivate at the following expression:
\begin{equation}
	t(z)= \frac{1}{\lambda}\log\left(\frac{A_0}{A_{z}}\right). \label{eq:CRS}
\end{equation}

The CRS model, equation \ref{eq:CRS}, is used to estimate the sediment ages by performing numerical integration. To do this, users () first calculate a supported $^{210}$Pb by subtracting the previously defined supported $^{210}$Pb from the measured $^{210}$Pb and multiplying the result by the density. This results in a vector of values, which can be used to estimate $A_0$ and $A_{z_i}$ and infer the ages of the bottom of each section. The actual calculation of these ages under different conditions is outside the scope of this paper and \citet{Sanchez-Cabeza2012} provide details on the proper use of the CRS model.


$A_0$ is a crucial amount for the CRS method, as this represents the total excess $^{210}$Pb in the sediment.
Therefore, excess $^{210}$Pb must reach $\sim$0 $\frac{Bq}{kg}$ (“background”; $\frac{Bq}{kg}$ is the SI unit for radioactive materials), i.e. total 210Pb and supported 210Pb must reach equilibrium. 
%The $^{210}$Pb dating community is well aware of this and they call the process of obtaining measurements from where there seems to be no excess $^{210}$Pb, ``reaching background''. 
Sediments cores that have not reached the background excess $^{210}$Pb are not suited for dating using this method. Regardless, some adaptations to the CRS model attempt to infer the missing $^{210}$Pb excess of the sediment by forcing the age-depth model to pass through a known dating marker \citep[a depth where its age is known from other methods or with a constant sedimentation rate][]{Sanchez-Cabeza2012}. However, in this work, we assume that the background is reached in all examples, so the standard CRS model may be used.
%Once more this modifications are outside the scope of our study and users interested in this should read . 

% The CRS  assumes a constant flux of excess $^{210}$Pb to the sediment and allows for changes in the sedimentation rate. 
% In order to allow for flexibility in the sedimentation rate, the CRS model uses remaining activity, obtained by multiplying $^{210}$Pb concentration and the density of the sediment. 

% This model also requires that the sediment be measured to the point where excess $^{210}$Pb is no longer detected, i.e., reaching equilibrium or background.
% In order to build a chronology, the CRS model uses a ratio between the complete ``inventory'' (the excess $^{210}$Pb activity accumulated in the sediment column, between the surface and the equilibrium depth, where excess $^{210}$Pb can no longer be detected) and the remaining inventory from depth \ac $x$ la x no estaba en modo matematico \ca to the previously defined equilibrium depth,

% where $A_0$ is the complete inventory, and $A_x$ is the inventory up to depth $x$.

\subsection{\textit{Plum}}

Plum \citep{Aquino2018} is an Bayesian model for producing $^{210}$Pb age-depth models.
This model is the first Bayesian method for dating $^{210}$Pb sediments and is receiving growing interest from the palaeoecological community.%, with more applications since its publication than the CF:CS model observed in the literature review by \citet{Courtney2019}.
\textit{Plum} assumes that there exists an (unknown) age-depth function $t(x)$ that relates depth $x$ with calendar age $t(x)$. 
Conditional on $t(x)$, the model is assumed for the measured $^{210}$Pb ($y_i$) between depths $x_i - \delta$ to $x_i$
\begin{eqnarray}
y_i \mid P^S_i, \Phi_i, t \sim \mathcal{N} \left(P^S_i \rho_i +\frac{\Phi_i}{\lambda} \left( e^{-\lambda t(x_i-\delta)} - e^{-\lambda t(x_i)} \right), (\sigma_i\rho_i)^2 \right). 
\end{eqnarray}
Here, the supported $^{210}$Pb ($P_i^S$) and the influx of excess $^{210}$Pb ($\Phi_i$) in section $i$ are considered as unknowns. The age-depth model $t(x)$ is assumed to follow a flexible semiparametric piece-wise linear model, which is constrained by prior information on sediment accumulation rates and their variability using a Gamma autoregressive model \citep{Blaauw2011}. The relationship between the measured data $y_i$ (the measured $^{210}$Pb) and the unknowns, i.e., the supported $^{210}$Pb, excess $^{210}$Pb, and the actual chronology, is explicitly modelled. This approach results in a likelihood, which is used to obtain a posterior distribution of $t(x)$ and the other parameters through Bayesian inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The resulting posterior distribution provides date estimates at each core depth. More technical details regarding \textit{Plum} may be found in \citep{Aquino2018}.

This data treatment allows for a formal statistical inference on a well-defined model and differs from the CRS model, which is not a likelihood-based approach. The CRS model employs the radioactive exponential decay equation to generate an age-depth function, leading to a limited age-depth model that solely considers the excess $^{210}$Pb. In our notation, this corresponds to assuming that $P_i^S$ is a known quantity. 

% \textit{Plum} has shown to provide accurate results with a realistic precision using different case scenarios \citep{Aquino2018,Aquino2020} - both in simulations as well as for real cores.

\section{Model considerations and experiment setup}\label{sec:exp_setup}

Since the CRS model has had several revisions, and the CRS version choice considerably affect model outputs \citep{Barsanti2020}, we decided to apply the original version provided by \citet{Appleby2001}, with its suggested error propagation calculation.  We will call this version of the CRS model the ``classical implementation of the CRS" (CI-CRS). 
While this implementation may be less suitable in some particular cases and expert knowledge can greatly improve the precision and accuracy of the CRS model, it reduces the bias of any particular implementation on our results.

% \subsection{Improvements to the CI-CRS}

Since the late 1970s, when the CRS model was first introduced \citep{Appleby1978,Robbins1978}, it has undergone several improvements.
For example, \citet{Barsanti2020} showed some modifications and improvements that can generate a range of age-depth models. Some improvements rely on independent dates, other isotopes, or techniques, and require user manipulation to "force" the method to agree with this information. One recent improvement, which requires little user manipulation and independent dates, is the comprehensive explanation, with expert notes, on the practical use of the CRS model by \citet{Sanchez-Cabeza2012}. 
They also presented an improvement to the uncertainty quantification of the age estimates by using the Monte Carlo method \citep{Sanchez-Cabeza2014} and released a publicly available Excel spreadsheet, which facilitates the calculation of their age estimates and Monte Carlo uncertainties. 
Considering that this paper focuses on methods with minimal user manipulation, and given that these modifications are laboratory-specific and not made publicly available, we also present and compare results using an R implementation (provided by the authors) of the improved CRS by \citet{Sanchez-Cabeza2014}, here labelled as revised CRS (R-CRS).

% The other models (CIC and CF:CS) were also considered in our simulation comparison study, but the results show a considerable bias, as well as an insufficient uncertainties to capture the true age-depth functions, as already mentioned and expected from such restrictive models.
% These model runs were performed using the \textit{serac} R package \citep{Bruel_2020}. 
% These results are shown in Appendix A.

\section{Simulations (experiment setup)}

	In order to quantify the accuracy and precision of any chronology, a known true age-depth function is required.
\citet{Blaauw2018} presented a methodology for simulating radiocarbon dates and their uncertainties, and \citet{Aquino2018} presented an approach for simulating $^{210}$Pb data given an age-depth function $t(x)$.
These simulations follow the equations presented by \cite{Appleby1978, Robbins1978} guaranteeing that the CRS model assumptions are met. 
By using the approach presented by \citet{Aquino2018} for simulating $^{210}$Pb data and the structure of uncertainty quantification presented by \citet{Blaauw2018}, realistic simulated $^{210}$Pb data may be obtained.

The simulation study was used to generate three different complete data sets, with ^210Pb measurements at every depth along the hypothetical core, which then were then sampled. This dataset sampling mimics the sample selection that each laboratory, or user, does on a real core. The quantity of samples is decided by the resources available to each project (budget, time) \citet{Blaauw2018}. 
In some cases, very few samples are selected to create an age-depth model.

\subsection{Simulation construction}\label{sec:SimConst}

Three scenarios were chosen to simulate sedimentation processes with their age-depth functions and parameters. These scenarios were selected as they provide three key challenges for the models:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Scenario 1 presents an age-depth function resulting from increasing sedimentation and less compaction towards the present (surface), a quite common scenario for more recent sediments. 
	
	\item Scenario 2 presents a challenging core structure since the age-depth function has a drastic and rapid shift in sediment accumulation around 15 cm depth, representing a change in environmental conditions (e.g. a change in local land use).
 
	\item Scenario 3 presents a cyclic and periodic change in accumulation rates, representing cyclic changes in environmental conditions (e.g. El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)). 
\end{itemize} 

Using the age-depth functions and parameters defined in Table \ref{tab:sim_param}, we obtain the $^{210}$Pb activity, or concentration, at any given depth interval $(a_1,a_2)$, by integrating the activity curve between $(t(a_1),t(a_2))$.  
In the real world, this process in the field is performed by cutting the sediment core at different depths and then measuring the $^{210}$Pb within them, so this integration reflects this process.
The integrated concentration maybe be interpreted as observing the true $^{210}$Pb concentration within the depth interval (section)
%YA NO ES NECESARIO DECIR ESTO, in some sense it can be define as error-free measurements 
(see Figure \ref{fig:true_210}).
Since there will always be measurement errors in any method used to measure these concentrations, it is crucial to correctly recreate these errors in the simulated data.

 %describes a methodology for replicating uncertainty around $^{14}$C ages. 
%The approach begins by creating a new variable called $\theta'$ that has a normal distribution around the real age (named $theta$).
%Variable $\theta'$ is then used to generate $\theta''$ which is shifted according to a uniform distribution $Unif(\theta' - x_{shift},\theta+x_{shift})$ with probability $p_{out}$ and is not shifted with probability $1-p_{out}$. 
%Afterward, variable $\theta'$ is utilised to produce $\theta"$, which is shifted with probability $p_{out}$ and not with probability $1-p_{out}$, as determined by a uniform distribution $\mathcal{U}(\theta' - x_{shift},\theta'+x_{shift})$, where $x_{shift}$ is some level of shift.
%Using the radiocarbon calibration curves from \citep{Reimer2013}, an estimated $14$C age ($mu(theta")$) is derived from $theta"$.
%$\mu(\theta'')$ is assumed to come from a normal distribution with standard deviation $\sigma =\max( \sigma_{min}~+~y_{scat}~+~\epsilon,\mu(\theta'') )$ where $\sigma_{min}$ is the minimum level of uncertainty around these measurements, usually defined by each laboratory, $\epsilon$ the analytical uncertainty (also defined by each laboratory and $y_{scat}$ an error multiplier.
 
Uncertainty for measured $^{210}$Pb  activity is recreated using an modified version of \citet{Blaauw2018}, developed for simulating radiocarbon dates under realistic working conditions.
This methodology was chosen as it introduces different sources of uncertainty related to different steps of the measurement process.
Other error simulation methodologies could be used, but the comparison remains valid as long as the same measurement errors are provided to both models.

\end{figure}

	Let $C_{i}$ be the true $^{210}$Pb concentration in the interval $[ x_i-\delta, x_i)$, given the age-depth function $t(x)$ and parameters $\Phi_i$ (influx of $^{210}$Pb) and $P_i^S$ (supported $^{210}$Pb) in each scenario. 
To simulate disturbances in the material, we can introduce dispersion around the true value, $y'_i \sim \mathcal{N}\left(C_i,s^2_{scat} \right)$, where $s^2$ is the amount of dispersion around the true value, in this case $s^2=10$ , which is similar to the levels proposed by \citet{Blaauw2018}. 

The occurrence of outliers is a crucial consideration when using these measures.
These outliers may be described as an error in the measuring processes, which results in a shift in the mean $y_i'$.
In order to replicate outliers, a random variable $\delta_{shift}$ is defined.
This variable will be $0$ with probability $1-p_{out}$ and $\mathcal{U}_a$ with probability $p_{out}$, where $\mathcal{U}_a$ is a uniform distribution between $(-a,a)$.
This process can be simulated using the following variable $\delta_{shift}\mid\beta \sim \beta\ \mathcal{U}_{x_{shift}}$, where $\beta$ is a Bernoulli random variable with parameter $p_{out}$, and $x_{shift}$ is the level of the outlier. 

Finally, to simulate the data provided by the laboratory, $y$ can defined as:   
\begin{align}
	y_i\sim\mathcal{N}\left(C_{i} + \delta_{shift}, \sigma^2_{R} \right), 
\end{align}
where $\sigma_R$ is the standard deviation reported by the laboratory. 
$\sigma_R$ is defined as $\sigma_R= \max \left(\sigma_{min}, \kappa~C_i ~\varepsilon \right)$, where $\sigma_{min}$ is the minimum standard deviation assigned to a measurement. As this variable differs between laboratories; we used a default value of $1~ Bq/kg$ (Becquerel over kilogram which an standard unit for radioactive material). 
Finally, $\varepsilon$ is the analytical measuring uncertainty (default 0.01 $\frac{Bq}{kg}$), and $\kappa$ an error multiplier (default 1.5).
The default parameters were set in following \citet{Blaauw2018}.


For this study, we created a dataset for each simulation by integrating in intervals by $\delta =$1 cm intervals for depths 0 to 30 cm, where radioactive equilibrium was guaranteed \citep{Aquino2018}.
The complete simulated $^{210}$Pb data sets can be found at \url{https://github.com/maquinolopez/Paper\_Simulations/tree/master/Code/Data}.

\subsection{Model considerations}

In order to create a comparison with minimal user interaction, each model was run automatically, with default settings.
Default settings for \textit{Plum} are; 1 cm model sections, 10 $\frac{cm}{yr}$ mean prior accumulation rate, 50 $\frac{yr Bq}{m^2}$ mean prior influx and 10 $\frac{Bq}{kg}$ mean prior supported $^{210}$Pb.
As the CRS model (for both the CI-CRS and R-CRS) assumes that supported and excess $^{210}$Pb have reached equilibrium, in order to reduce user input, we decided to fix the last sample (30 cm depth) for every case, as this allows every model to reach equilibrium. This step guarantees the consistent application of the CRS model and provides the model with a single bottom-most depth to be removed as required by the CRS model calculation process. 
Furthermore, as the CRS model only works with the excess $^{210}$Pb, when certain excess activities reached negative values, the chronology was calculated below that depth.
\textit{Plum} deals with the supported $^{210}$Pb variable automatically, as part of the inference.
Consequently, \textit{Plum}'s resulting chronology always reaches 30 cm, as by default 1 cm sections are used for every simulation.

In the case of the supported $^{210}$Pb and to reduce the influence of this variable, %in the bias of the models,
a constant level of supported $^{210}$Pb was assumed for both models, in agreement with the simulations construction. % which coincides with the way in which the simulations were constructed.
For the CRS model, the mean of the supported $^{210}$Pb measurements was calculated and then subtracted from the total $^{210}$Pb to obtain the excess $^{210}$Pb.
In contrast to certain implementations that directly subtract $^{226}$Ra from the total $^{210}$Pb, we opted for a different approach in this study. Our decision was driven by the desire to minimize the influence of individual outliers on the Constant Rate of Supply (CRS) model. Instead, we determined that calculating the mean value of the supported $^{210}$Pb samples would yield a more accurate estimation of this variable. By employing this method, the CRS model benefits from an improved estimate of the supported $^{210}$Pb, which is less susceptible to the influence of individual outliers.

% In order to provide an objective comparison, the bias of the true age-depth model (in yr), length of the 95\% intervals (in yr) and coverage (bias over the standard deviation) were calculated (the coverage indicates the distance of modelled ages from the true value given the model's own uncertainty). 
% The main discussion will revolve around the coverage as it provide an intuitive measure of the accuracy a model by taking into account the levels of uncertainty provided by each model.

\section{Model comparison}

To allow for a reasonable comparison between models, and to evaluate the effect that varying amounts of information may have on the accuracy and precision of $^{210}$Pb models (reflected in this study as the bias and coverage, respectively), the three simulated data sets were used. 
As the sample size is strongly dependentstrongly depends on a project’s project's budget and time, we considered the use of a varying sample size. Ssamples from the entire core or a portion of the core could be measured or only a portion of it. In order to analyze the effects of sample sizes, samples of size m were randomly generated to provided an  percentage of information percentage, e.g., for a 20\% information, a dataset with 6 random 1-cm samples sections -out of a possible total 30 (maximum) 1-cm samples- is was created. This sample was then used to create the chronology and calculate the bias, length of estimated intervals, and coverage. One hundred : 100 of these sub-datasets were created for different information percentages (from 10\% to 95\% at 5\% intervals). 
The complete dataset was also used (i.e., 100\% information percentage sample, namely, a fully analyzed core).
Once a dataset was created, the CRS model and \textit{Plum} were applied. %(CIC and CF:CS were also applied and results are shown in the \ac Appendix~\ref{} \ca).  
Both outputs were then compared against the true known age value, see Figure~\ref{fig:comparison1r}.

\begin{figure}[!]

	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{95Comparison.pdf}

Dots show the coverage, i.e. the distance between the inferred age and the true age in relation to the standard error (the standard deviation in the case of the CI-CRS and the length of the confidence interval divided by 4 in the case of \textit{Plum}).

		\label{fig:comparison1r}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:comparison1r} shows a single ``snapshot", as an example of the comparison between the $^{210}$Pb models against the true value in every scenario. 
As we are dealing with a total of n=5,333 simulations, in order to evaluate the overall precision and accuracy of both models, we calculated the mean bias of the true age-depth model (in yr), the mean of length of the 95\% intervals (in yr), and the mean coverage indicating the distance of modelled ages from the true value given the model’s model's own uncertainty at each depth.

	\caption{Bias between the modelled and true age of the CI-CRS (red), R-CRS (green), and Plum (blue) as a function of the amount of 210Pb data (\% of information). Plum provides a small bias in almost every scenario, with both models improving their bias as more information is available. B) 95\% confidence intervals and credible intervals in the case of Plum. The uncertainty provided by Plum is significantly larger for low percentages of information, and it constantly improves as more data are available. In contrast, the intervals provided by the CI-CRS and R-CRS appear to not decrease regardless of the available information (though maximum interval lengths tend to reduce as more information becomes available). C) Coverage, presenting the distance between the modelled age and the true age divided by the standard deviation (in the case of Plum, the length of the 95\% interval divided by 4). The CI-CRS and R-CRS model's calculated standard deviation (on average) cannot capture the true age (running at distances over 2 standard deviations from the truths). On the other hand, Plum's credible intervals almost always capture the true age, even when little information is available.}
  \label{fig:accpre}
\end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig:accpre} shows similar results to those presented by \citet{Blaauw2018}. 
The classical model (CI-CRS and R-CRS) at first appears to provide a similar results to \textit{Plum}, with significant greater biasses regarles of the amount of information provided to the method. On the other hand, the classical approaches appear to provide higher estimated precision, if we only consider the length of the 95\% interval. 
It is important to note that the CI-CRS and R-CRS models' biases do improve if more information is available, but are always greater than those provided by \textit{Plum}. 
%However, if we do not consider the effects of both the bias and length of the interval together, the results are not favourable to the CI-CRS. 
To have a more realistic representation of how the models capture the true age-depth relationship, we consider the coverage. 
This variable shows the degree to which the models contain the truth within their uncertainty intervals (normalized to one standard deviation). Any model with coverage larger than two (two standard deviations) cannot capture the true ages within its uncertainty intervals. While the CI-CRS and R-CRS estimate smaller uncertainties (confidence intervals) and the ages improve as sample size increases, it does so at the cost of accuracy as the improvements are insufficient to capture the true age. It also appears that the length of the 95\% interval and bias are not affected by how much information is provided to the CRS model.

On the other hand, \textit{Plum} seems to provide increasingly accurate results as more information is provided.
Again, this agrees with the results outlined by \citet{Blaauw2018}. 
When we observe the regular bias (not normalized), we find that \textit{Plum} provides a smaller bias in comparison to the CI-CRS and R-CRS models; this, in combination with slightly larger (more realistic) modelled uncertainties, results in more consistently accurate age-depth models that can capture the true values within their uncertainty intervals. 
In fact, 87.86\% (4686/5333) of \textit{Plum}'s runs remain within the 2 standard deviations, opposed to 7.48\% (399/5333) of the CI-CRS models runs. 
Furthermore, only 0.54\% (29/5333) of the CI-CRS model runs remain under one standard deviation, the most commonly reported interval when reporting CI-CRS results, with R-CRS providing very similar results.
This result supports the claim that \textit{Plum} provides more realistic uncertainties compared those obtained by the CI-CRS and R-CRS. 
Furthermore, it is evident that \textit{Plum} exhibits rapid improvement in its credible interval length as additional information becomes available, with a mostly constant coverage, guaranteeing that the true age-depth model will be contained in the credible intervals. On the other hand, the CI-CRS and R-CRS models do not show a notable enhancement in their coverage until at least 75\% of the information is available. Even then, the length of their intervals is insufficient to capture the true ages within their 2 standard deviation confidence intervals. Given the similarity of results between the CI-CRS and R-CRS models, the subsequent analysis will primarily focus on the CRS model, using the CI-CRS as the reference point for subsequent calculations.

% We also observe that \textit{Plum} increases its accuracy and precision to produce a better chronology as more information is available, whereas the CI-CRS and R-CRS models do not improve their coverage with additional data. 
% As we obtained very similar results from both the CI-CRS and R-CRS, the discussion will now focus on the CRS in general taking the CI-CRS as its base for the following calculations.

In order to evaluate whether certain models better predict ages at certain sections of the sediment cores, we look at the coverage of every depth. These results are valid for the overall chronology (mean bias, interval, and coverage of the overall chronology).

	\begin{centering}

Dots go from lowest information percentage samples (few dated depths; red) to high percentage samples (nearly completely dated cores; purple). The CI-CRS's coverage shows no learning pattern at any particular depth, regardless of the available information (apart from narrowing coverage at deeper depths). This means that the CRS model can provide a reasonable chronology with low levels of information or an inaccurate age estimate with high levels of information. On the other hand, Plum demonstrates a systematic improvement in its age estimates as more data are available. As a likelihood-based approach, these results show that Plum consistently provides more reliable results.  }

	\end{centering}
\end{figure}
The coverage of each simulation at different depths is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:depths} for both models. Plum demonstrates a noticeable learning pattern, influenced by the amount of available information, although an unusual inverse pattern is observed in scenario 2. On the other hand, the coverage of the CI-CRS model appears to be minimally affected by the percentage of information, in contrast to the findings of Plum. The inaccuracies of the CI-CRS model are not confined to specific sections of the chronology, suggesting that this is likely due to the small uncertainties estimated by the CI-CRS model.

\section{Discussion and Conclusions}

This research focuses on exploring the uncertainty and precision of the most commonly used $^{210}$Pb dating method (CRS) in contrast to \textit{Plum}.
By using different scenarios, three different simulations were created. These simulations were then sub-sampled at different percentages of information to observe the effects of different sample sizes on the resulting chronologies. This experiment was designed to objectively compare the accuracy and precision of both methods.


The experiment was conducted on two levels.
First, we evaluated the overall accuracy and precision of each method.
The mean of the bias, length of the 95\% confidence and credible intervals, as well as the coverage were measured.
Second, we quantified the ability of each model to capture the true value in their credible/confidence interval (coverage) of each scenario at every depth. These two comparisons provided a good picture of the difference in precision and accuracy between these methods.


From the overall accuracy (see Figure \ref{fig:accpre}), both the CRS model and \textit{Plum} reduce their bias as more data becomes available, with the Bayesian method providing, on average, a smaller bias regardless of the sample size. 
In terms of precision, the Bayesian method provides much larger uncertainties when small sample sizes are used. 
It is only with 60\%, or more of information that the length of the intervals becomes comparable, meaning that it takes \textit{Plum} much more information to achieve the same length of the credible intervals provided by the classical approach. 
This is a consequence of the linear/exponential interpolation between data points used by the CRS method, in contrast to the Bayesian approach (\textit{Plum}).  

The larger uncertainties provided by \textit{Plum} are more realistic, as confirmed in this work.
Further evidence that these uncertainties are more reasonable is that the widths of Plum's credible intervals become smaller as more data becomes available.
On the other hand, the length of the confidence intervals provided by the classical model (CRS) remain almost constant at any sample size, with reduced biases as more data is available.
Lastly, the coverage, which shows the ability of the model to capture the true values within their intervals, shows that the classical model (CRS), on average is incapable of capturing the true values within its 95\% confidence interval. 
These results are of concern, as the classical $^{210}$Pb dating community rarely reports 95\% confidence intervals and instead uses only 65\% confidence intervals (one standard deviation intervals).
On the other hand, \textit{Plum}'s coverages almost always remain $\leq 2$, guaranteeing that on average the true value is captured within its 95\% credible intervals, even with small sample sizes.
Furthermore, \textit{Plum}'s coverages are constantly improving and reaching stability with 50\% or more of the information percentage.
These experiments show that the Bayesian method, on average, provides more reliable results for both precision and accuracy, no matter the amount of information.

As the coverage demonstrates how well each model can estimate the real value within its intervals, this variable may be used to assess if a certain approach offers a more accurate estimate for various periods.
Figure \ref{fig:depths} presents the performance of both the CRS model and \textit{Plum} for every simulated scenario by depth.
It appears that the coverage of many of the CRS chronologies do not follow a clear estructure, meaning that the model does not have a period of time for which it is more precise. 
Moreover, the CRS does not exhibit a clear learning pattern, where the coverage is not much affected by the amount of information available.
Even high levels of information percentage provide coverages $> 2$, in some cases closer to 4 for scenarios 2 and 3.
\textit{Plum} on the other hand, shows a structure where more data are reflected in improved models in scenarios 1 and 3.
It is only at low levels of information where \textit{Plum}'s coverage is $>2$.
Scenario 2, on the other hand, presents a case where \textit{Plum} cannot capture the true value, for depths $>15$ cm, and it appears that as more data becomes available, the model provides worse results. 
We recognize that this scenario is unrealistic as it presents an extreme change in the accumulation around 15 cm, which coincides with the depth at which the coverage becomes $>2$.
However, it is also important to acknowledge that this experiment was performed using default settings.  
In a real-world scenario, the user typically has some prior knowledge of the sedimentation process in about the site of interest, which could be incorporated as prior information to the model to improve the resulting chronology for both the CRS and \textit{Plum} models.

% The results obtained by this experiment appear to persist even in the case of the revised version of the CRS model (R-CRS).
% The R-CRS model appears to improve the bias but this improvement appears to be nullified by the smaller uncertainties presented by \citet{Sanchez-Cabeza2014}.
% The question of which version of the CRS provides the best result is beyond the scope of this research and is dependent on expert application of the model.
% Nevertheless, it is important to note that that the bias, related to the CI-CRS and R-CRS, are reasonably small at certain sections of the sediment, but the uncertainty quantification of both methods is overly optimistic.  

In conclusion, the use of the Bayesian age-depth models is recommended for the consistent construction of sediment chronologies, not only on radiocarbon-based chronologies as presented by \citet{Blaauw2018} but also in the more complex case of $^{210}$Pb shown here.
While the classical approach provides a reduction of the bias as more data is available, the uncertainty quantification in these methods is insufficient, which may be a results of not being based on a proper statistical structure. 
In a real-world scenario, it is impossible to measure the true bias of a method, and therefore a proper uncertainty quantification becomes extremely important.
These results support the recommendations presented by \citet{Smith2001,Barsanti2020}, where the CRS method, or any dating methodology, should be validated using independent dating markers. 

Both \citet{Blaauw2018} and the present work show that Bayesian methods constantly improve as more data are added, and the uncertainty associated with the the method is realistic and coherent with the amount of information available. 
This leads to chronologies that can capture the true age in their credible intervals, especially with minimal expert input (unlike the CRS, which relies on expert modifications and modifications). 
The ability to capture the true value within the credible intervals becomes important when the problem is associated with decision making processes, as it provides a more realistic picture of the available knowledge of the process. 
Given that $^{210}$Pb-dating is now widely used in studies of pollution, environmental dynamics, and climate change, which potentially have a high impact on both policy-making and public perception, realistic age estimates and uncertainties, as well as estimates of rates of change over time, become extremely important.

% Bias, length of 95\% confidence intervals (credible intervals for \textit{Plum}) and coverage of the CIC and CF:CS models are shown in Figure \ref{fig:CIC-CFCS}.
% As can be observed and as expected the bias of the CIC model (which can be considered the simplest model) is much bigger when compared to any other alternative and it does not decrease as more data are available.
% The confidence interval remains the same regardless of the information available, and coverage is almost always above two, which means that the uncertainties are not sufficient to capture the true age-depth model.
% On the other hand the CF:CS model does decrease its bias as more data are available and after 60\% to 70\% this decrease does not seen improve.
% The length of the interval remains the same regardless of the information available and the coverage just like the CIC model is almost always above 2 meaning that the uncertainties are not sufficient.

% These results are consistent with the discussion in the paper as classical model appear to not improve as more data are available.
% Its bias does decrease as more data are available (in the case of the CF:CS model) but its uncertainty is underestimated which in turn does not allow the method to have a reasonable coverage.
