	%To understand changes in peat accumulation in response to recent and rapid climate or anthropogenic change, accurate ages for the last 100-200 years are essential. Dating this period is often complicated by poor resolution and large errors associated with calibrating radiocarbon (14C) ages. The use of lead-210 ($^{210}Pb$) is a popular method as it allows for the measurement of absolute and continuous dates for the last ~150 years of peat accumulation. 
%In ombrotrophic peatlands, the lead-210 dating method has traditionally relied on the Constant Rate of Supply (CRS) model which uses the radioactive decay equation to provide a logarithmic model to approximate dates, resulting in a restrictive model. Key limitations of the CRS model are: (1) the accurate assessment of the supported lead which varies between sites and can be problematic if sampling of the total inventory is not continuous (e.g. interval measurements, lack of sample); (2) the inconsistent estimation of uncertainties. The Plum model was developed in a statistical framework with a Bayesian approach, notably resulting in longer chronologies, more realistic uncertainty estimations, and has the advantage of not double-modelling dates for final age-depth models, primarily radiocarbon and 210Pb chronologies. 
%Here, we present two thorough tests of Plum. First, we created scenarios using simulated datasets with known age-depth functions in a range of shapes and with varying sampling resolution. These simulations are created using the physical behaviour that most 210Pb dating models are based on. Plum and CRS model outputs are compared under each scenario. We also take this opportunity to demonstrate the new Plumâ€™s R package, for use by non-statisticians in palaeoecological studies. We also compare the lead-210 dates derived from CRS models and from Plum using real peat cores with additional independent dating controls from Eastern Canada. These cores represent a thorough test for Plum, as permafrost thaw drastically changes stratigraphy and peat type (e.g. shift from ligneous peat to Sphagnum moss) which affects 210Pb retention within the peat. Recent decadal-scale changes are still poorly represented so accurate dating is now essential to quantify changes in carbon accumulation rates and predict future trends.

\section{Introduction}

$^{210}Pb$ is a radioactive nuclide which naturally forms in the atmosphere (as well as in the sediment) as result of the decay chain of $^{238}U$. 
This isotope, with a half-life if 22.23 yr, is commonly used to date recent recently accumulated sediments ($<150$ to $200$ yr). 
Unlike to other dating techniques such as $^{14}C$ (radiocarbon), a single measurement of $^{210}Pb$ is useless for dating and it is only when a suitable portion of the decay curve is measured (together with certain assumptions about the sedimentation process) that a chronology can be established.  
In recent decades, increasing amounts of palaeoecological and pollution studies have focused on recent sediments \citep[e.g.,][]{Courtney2019} in order to measure the human impact in the environment.
These studies strongly depend on the accuracy of the chronologies in order to correctly assign dates to chemical and biological changes.

A range of traditional models are available for dating recent sediment using $^{210}Pb$, most notably is the Constant Rate of Supply (CRS), Constant Flux:Constant sedimentation (CF:CS) and Constant Initial Concentration (CIC) model \citep{Appleby1978,Robbins1978,Sanchez-Cabeza2012} . 
The CRS model, also known as Constant Flux - (CF) model is by far the most popular (see figure \ref{fig:210models}) and has the most flexible assumptions. 
The CRS model assumes a constant supply of $^{210}Pb$ to the sediment from the atmosphere and allows for changes in the sedimentation rate. 
In order to estimate a chronology the CRS model uses a ratio between the complete inventory (the complete estimate of the radioactivity in the column of the sediment between the surface and a certain depth where $^{210}Pb$ from the atmosphere can no longer be found) and the remaining  inventory from depth $x$ ($t(x)=\frac{1}{\lambda}\log\left( \frac{A_0}{A_x}\right)$, where $A_0$ is the complete inventory, $\lambda$ the decay constant of the $^{210}Pb$ $\approx .03114$).

Other, more restrictive models such as CF:CS and CIC requiere the assumption of a constant supply of $^{210}Pb$ as well as other assumptions of the sedimentation process. 
The flexibility of the CRS, regarding its assumptions, comes at the cost of the need to measure a sufficient portion of the inventory or the use of interpolation in order to properly estimate the complete inventory of $^{210}Pb$ in the sediment. 

This model has received several revisions  in order to improve its accuracy and applicability. 
There are two types of revisions to this model: revisions to its uncertainty \citep{Binford1990,Appleby2001,Sanchez-Cabeza2014} and to its applicability when extra information is available, such asextra dating sources (e.g. $^{137}Cs$) or laminated sediments- \citep{Appleby1998,Appleby2001,Appleby2008}.

A recent inter-laboratory experiment \citep{Barsanti2020}, presented a series of $^{210}Pb$ data to different laboratories around the world.
Each laboratory was ask to provide a chronology given the provided data.
This experiment resulted in a whole range of different chronologies, given the same data, not only when different models were used, but even when the same model was applied.
The authors strongly advised to the use of independent time markers (extra dating sources) to validae of the chronologies.
This research clearly shows the effect that user decisions have on the resulting chronologies, an this becomes extremely important when trying to replicate the resulting chronologies.
Users trying to replicate these chronologies will not only need access to the raw data but also to every user decision which lead to the resulting chronology; unfortunately these raw data and decisions- are rarely reported.

	\end{centering}
\end{figure}

Recently \citet{Aquino2018} presented an alternative to these classical models, by introducing \textit{Plum} a Bayesian approach to the $^{210}Pb$ dating methodology. 
This model treats every data point as originating from a system, which includes the sedimentation process as well as the decay process. 
It also incorporates an important variable to the inferred processes, the levels of supported $^{210}Pb$, which naturally forms in the sediment and is normally threaded as a hindrance variable.
Plum assumes that there exists a function $t(x)$ such that,
\begin{eqnarray}
y_i\mid P^S_i, \Phi_i, \bar{t}\sim \mathcal{N} \left(A^S_i+\frac{\Phi_i}{\lambda} \left( e^{-\lambda t(x_i-\delta)} - e^{-\lambda t(x_i)} \right), (\sigma_i\rho_i)^2 \right). 
\end{eqnarray}
where $y_i$ is the amount of $^{210}Pb$ in a sample, $A_i^S$ is the supported $^{210}Pb$ in the sample, $\Phi_i$ the supply of $^{210}Pb$ to the sediment, $\delta$ the thickness of the sample and $t(x_i)$ the age of the sample at depth $x_i$. 
The age-depth model is based on a piece-wise linear model constrained by prior information on accumulation rate and its variability \citep{Blaauw2011}.

This treatment of the data allows for a formal statistical inference and by using a Bayesian approach all the parameters of the model can be inferred.
This differs from the CRS model because the latter last one uses the decay equation to obtained the age-depth function (which results in a more restrictive age-depth model), removes assumed values of supported $^{210}Pb$ before modelling, and does not provide a formal statistical inference.
\textit{Plum} has shown to provide accurate results with a realistic precision depending on the different case scenarios \citep{Aquino2020} - both in simulations as well as for real cores.
Under optimal conditions \textit{Plum} and the CRS model have shown to provide similar results \citep{Aquino2020} with \textit{Plum} providing more realistic uncertainties, with minimal user interaction. 

\citet{Blaauw2018} presented a comparison between classical and Bayesian age-depth models construction, both for real and simulated $^{14}C$-dated cores.
They concluded that Bayesian age-depth models provide a more accurate result and more realistic uncertainties under a wide range of scenarios - simulations and real cores.  
In this study, we compare the CRS model (by far the most popular age-depth model for $^{210}Pb$) against \textit{Plum} using simulated cores (sedimentation "scenarios").
The objective of this analysis is to observe if the results that \citet{Blaauw2018} obtained are maintained in a more difficult situation as that of the construction of age-depth models using $^{210}Pb$.
We also wish to observe the learning process of each of the models and how much information is needed to obtained a reasonable chronology given a particular model.

\section{Simulations and Information Percentage}
	In order to observe the accuracy and precision of any model, we need data where the true age-depth function is known.
\citet{Blaauw2018} presented a methodology for simulating radiocarbon dates and their uncertainty, whereas \citet{Aquino2018} presented an approach for simulating $^{210}Pb$ data given an age-depth function $f(t)$.
It is important to note that these simulations follow the equations presented by \citet*{Appleby1978,Robbins1978} guaranteeing that the CRS assumptions are met. 
By using the approach presented by \citet{Aquino2018} for simulating $^{210}Pb$ data and the structure of uncertainty estimation presented by \citet{Blaauw2018}, reliable $^{210}Pb$ simulated data can be obtained.

\subsection{Simulation Construction}\label{sec:SimConst}

Three different scenarios (see table \ref{tab:sim_param}) were chosen for our simulations of sedimentation, each with their own age-depth functions and parameters. 
This scenarios were selected as they provide three challenges for the models: the first scenario presents an age-depth function which is quite common for recent sediments (with less compaction toward the surface at 0 cm depth), the second scenario presents a challenging core as the function replicates a drastic and quick change in sediment behaviour around depth 15 cm depth, and lastly proposal three presents a cyclic and periodic change in accumulation. 
Using the age-depth functions and defined parameters in table \ref{tab:sim_param}, we can obtained the activity at any depth or interval (by integrating the age-depth curve in such interval).

\begin{table}[!h]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l|ccc}
Label    	& 	Age-depth		&	$ \Phi$		& Supported $^{210}Pb$  \\

Scenario 1 	&	$\frac{x^2}{4} + \frac{x}{2}$	&	100	& 10	\\
Scenario 2 	&	$12x -.2x^2$			&	50	& 25	\\
Scenario 3 	&	$8x+25\sin(\frac{x}{\pi})$	&	500 	& 15		
	\end{tabular}
	\label{tab:sim_param}
	\caption{Simulated age-depth function and parameters used in each scenario}
 \end{table}

\begin{figure}[!h]

	\caption{Simulated sedimentation scenarios with their corresponding $^{210}Pb$ profiles. Upper panel: Age-depth function for the three different scenarios (Table \ref{tab:sim_param}). Lower panel: Corresponding $^{210}Pb$ profiles in relation to depth.}
  \label{fig:true_210}
\end{figure}

	These concentrations (see Figure \ref{fig:true_210}) can be interpreted as error-free measurements. 
Because all equipment is subject to error, we need to replicate the measurement errors. 
\citet{Blaauw2018} presents error structure for radiocarbon dates. 
We can use this structure to our $^{210}Pb$ measurements as both measurements are subject to similar measurement problems. 

	Let $C_{\hat{x}}$ be the true  $^{210}Pb$ concentration in the interval $\hat{x}=[a,b)$, given the age-depth function $t(x)$ and parameters $\Phi$ and $A^S$. 
To simulate disturbances in the material, we can introduce scatter centred around the true value, $\theta \sim \mathcal{N}\left(C_{\hat{x}},y^2_{scat}\right)$, where $x^2_{scat}$ is the amount of scatter for this variable (in this case $y^2_{scat}=10$). 
Now, to replicate outliers, a shift from the true value ($x_{shift}$) is defined, which occurs with a probability $p_{out}$. This results in a new variable $\theta'$ which is defined as
\begin{align}
	\theta' = \begin{cases}
			\mathcal{U}(\theta - x_{shift},\theta + x_{shift}), &  p_{out} \\
			\theta, & 1-p_{out}
		\end{cases}.
\end{align}

	To simulate the uncertainty provided by the laboratory, we can define the simulated measurements as  $y(\theta')\sim\mathcal{N}\left(\theta',\sigma_R^2\right)$, where $\sigma_R$ is the standard deviation reported by the laboratory. 
$\sigma_R$ is defined as $\sigma_R= \max \left(\sigma_{min}, \mu(\theta')~\varepsilon~y_{scat}~\right)$, where $\sigma_{min}$ is the minimum standard deviation assigned to a measurement. This variable differs between laboratories (we will be using a default value of $1~ Bq/kg$). 
Finally, $\varepsilon$ is the analytical uncertainty (default .01) and $y_{scat}$ an error multiplier (default 1.5).

	For this this study we created a data set for each simulation by integrating in intervals of 1 cm from 0 to 30 depth (where equilibrium was guaranteed).
The complete simulated $^{210}Pb$ data sets can be found in the Supplementary Material \ref{sec:supp_mat}, and Figure \ref{fig:true_210} shows the $^{210}Pb$ concentration curves with their corresponding age-depth functions. 

\subsection{Percentage of information}

	With these data sets, we then define a new variable called percentage of information. 
This variable relates to how much of the available information was measured. 
We assumed that background was reached at depth $m$, information percentage is define as how much area of the core was measured, e.g. 
If background was reached at depth $m=100$ cm and the core was sampled using 20 $1$ cm thick slices, the percentage of information would be 20 \%. 
This variable will help us to have a measuring tool for how much information is needed for a good chronology without depending on the number or size of the samples. 

In order to compare both the CRS and \textit{Plum} under simular circumstances, the previously described data sets will be randomly selected for samples given an information percentage. 
In the case of cores which have not reached background, \textit{Plum} \citep{Aquino2018} has shown to provide accurate results without the need for user interference. 
On the other hand, in such cases the CRS can only provide a chronology if the complete inventory is estimated using extrapolation and if the model is forced to pass through a known date (e.g., as estimated by a 137Cs peak related to the AD 1986 Chernobyl accident). .
This means user intervention and to avoid this problem and to provide a more objective comparison, here every simulated sampling set will reach background, which guarantees the proper use of the CRS model.

\section{Model Comparison}

To allow for a reasonable comparison between models and to observe the effect that different percentage of information have on the accuracy and precision of $^{210}Pb$ models, we used the three simulated data sets created for the previous section. 
These simulated cores were randomly selected given a percentage of information (e.g. for a 20\% information sample, in a 30 cm cores, 6 random 1-cm samples were simulated). 
Because the CRS model assumes that background has being reached (in order to reduce user manipulation), we decided to fix the last sample (30 cm depth) for every case.
This guaranties the proper use of the CRS model and also gives the model a single last depth to be removed as it is common practice when using the CRS model.
100 different samples were randomly selected for information percentages from 10\% to 95\% at 5\% intervals (i.e., 10\%, 15\%, 20\%,...,95\%)  and the complete sample was also used (i.e 100\% percentage of information sample).
After a random sample was selected, both the CRS model and \textit{Plum} were run and their outputs compared to the true age value to calculate its accuracy.
\textit{Plum} was run using the default settings.

In order to observe the precision and accuracy, we decided to calculate the offset (in yr), the mean of length of the 95\% intervals (in yr), as well as the normalized accuracy (this indicates how far the model is from the true value given its own uncertainty at that depth).  

%% Aqui toy
\begin{figure}[!]
 \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.75\linewidth]{AccPrec.pdf}
	\caption{Comparison of the offset (distance between the true age and model), the lenght of the 95\% confidence interval (classical) and credible interval (Bayesian) and the normalized offset for the classical CRS model (red) and the Bayesian approach \textit{Plum} (blue). Top panel A) shows the offset between the true age and modelled age of the CRS (red) and \textit{Plum} (blue). Middle panel B) shows the 95\% confidence intervals. Bottom panel C) shows the normalized offsets, presenting the distance between the modelled age and the true age normalized divided by the standard deviation (in the case of \textit{Plum}, the length of the 95\% interval divided by 4), CRS in red and \textit{Plum} in blue.    }
  \label{fig:accpre}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:accpre} show similar results those presented by \citet{Blaauw2018}. 
The classical model (CRS) at first appears to provide a similar results (similar offsets) to the Bayesian alternative (\textit{Plum}), but at higher estimated precision (if we only look at the length of the 95\% interval). 
These results can be misleading if we don't analysed the effects of both the offset and length of interval together. 
To have a more realistic representation of how the models capture the true age-depth models we can observe the normalized offset. 
This variable shows to which degree the average models contain the truth within their uncertainty intervals (normalized to one standard deviation). 
Any model with normalized offset larger than two (two standard deviations) is incapable of capturing the true ages within their uncertainty intervals.  
This means that the CRS estimates smaller uncertainties, yet at the cost of its accuracy.
It also appears that the length of the 95\% interval and offset are not affected by how much information is provided to the CRS model. 

On the other hand, \textit{Plum}, which is a Bayesian method, shows more accurate results as more information is given to the model.
This again coincides with the results found by \citet{Blaauw2018}. 
When we observe the regular offset (not normalized), we observed that Plum provides a smaller offset in comparison to the CRS model; this in combination with slightly larger modelled uncertainties results in consistently accurate age-depth models which are capable of capturing the true values within their uncertainty intervals. 
This result supports the claim that \textit{Plum} provides more realistic uncertainties than those of the CRS.

%Figure \ref{fig:maps} presents 

	Another important statistic to take into account is that 87.86\% (4686/5333) of \textit{Plum}'s runs remain under the 2 standard deviations, whereas the CRS model only has 7.48\% (399/5333) under the 2 standard deviations, and only 0.54\% (29/5333) lies under the 1 standard deviation, which is the most commonly reported interval when reporting CRS results.
We can also observe a clear structure in the way Plum increases its accuracy and precision to obtained a better chronology as more information is available, whereas the CRS model does not appears to learn from more data. 
These results are presented for the overall chronology (the mean offset, interval and normalized offset of the overall chronology). 
In order to observe if certain models are better predicting at certain section of the sediment, we have to look at the normalized offset of every depth. 


\begin{figure}[!]
	\begin{centering}

		\caption{Normalized accuracy of every sampling at every depth for the three simulated scenarios. Dots go from lowest information percentage samples (few dated depths; red) to high percentage samples (nearly completely dated cores; purple). Top figures are the normalized offset of the CRS model and the bottom ones are the results for Plum. Columns from left to right show the results for simulated cores 1, 2 and 3.}
		\label{fig:depths}
	\end{centering}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:depths} shows the normalized accuracy of every simulation by depth for both models.
\textit{Plum} shows a clear learning structure which depends on the information available to the model.
The information percentage appears to be irrelevant to the accuracy of the CRS model, contrary to the results obtained by \textit{Plum}.
It is important to note that the inaccuracies of the CRS model are not exclusive to any particular sections of the chronology; this is most likely caused by the small uncertainties estimated by the CRS model.See below for a discussion of how Plum behaved in sedimentation simulation 2.

\section{Conclusions and Discussion}

These results clearly show the bias of the CRS model. 
\citet{Aquino2018} discussed this point and states that the bias is the product of the use of a logarithmic function for the age-depth function. 
It is also evident from these results that the CRS model's uncertainty estimates are not sufficient to capture the true age-depth function. 
This is an important point given the fact that it is common practice among the $^{210}Pb$ dating community to report credible intervals to one single deviation (instead of the 95\% confidence intervals, which have become common practice in most other chronology reconstructions).
Other confidence intervals can be calculated for this model \citep{Sanchez-Cabeza2014} but the fact that these intervals are even smaller than the ones obtained by error propagation \citep{Appleby2001} is of concern. 

Previous work on model comparison \citep{Barsanti2020} has shown the problems with the variability of $^{210}Pb$ results even when different users apply the same or similar models to a single set of data.
In this work, user input was reduced to the minimum in an effort to show the potential effects of different information percentages have on the resulting chronology. 
The results of this experiment showed that the CRS model can provide extremely different results even when the data originates from the same data set. 
Figure \ref{fig:accpre} showed that the CRS model appears not to learn from using more data.
This explains why over the years, many authors have insisted in the use of other dating techniques to validate the chronology provided by the CRS model \citep{Sanchez-Cabeza2012,Barsanti2020,Aquino2020}.
These results highly encourage the need of validating the CRS chronology before it is use.


On the other hand, \textit{Plum} shows a consistently accurate result by capturing the true values within the 95\% credible intervals in by most of the simulated sampling strategies. 
It is important to note that one of the big advantages of \textit{Plum} is its increasing accuracy and precision reduction as more data becomes available.
In the case of proposal 2, we observe that \textit{Plum} appears to behaves worse as more data is available, which would be of concern if we do not take into consideration that this sedimentation simulation was extremely unusual in the real world and also if users would not double check the resulting chronologies. 
If more information is available about the core or the sediment, this information can easily be implemented as prior information in \textit{Plum}, and this will result in a much better chronology.
It is also important to note that even when \textit{Plum} performs badly in this specific case, it is providing a much better chronology to upper first 10-15 cm of the core than that of the chaotic CRS age-depth model model.

In conclusion, we recommend that users validate their chronology when possible, and if not extra information is available for this validation, we recommend them to use the Bayesian approach and provide it with as as many $^{210}Pb$ measurements as possible (at least 60\% of the available information of the core).  
This will guaranties that they they get the best possible chronology
